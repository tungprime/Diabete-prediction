Diabetes has become a more and more severe problem. According to the following  <a href="https://www.diabetes.org/resources/statistics/statistics-about-diabetes#:~:text=Prevalence%3A%20In%202018%2C%2034.2%20million,of%20the%20population%2C%20had%20diabetes.&text=Undiagnosed%3A%20Of%20the%2034.2%20million,and%207.3%20million%20were%20undiagnosed"> website </a>, more than 10% of Americans had diabetes in 2018. 

In 2017 alone, diabetes caused more than 200,000 deaths in America. In the same year, the total cost to treat diabetes is $327 billion.

All these alarming numbers urge scientists to build more precise models to predict diabetes so that appropriate actions could be taken to combat the disease. That is precisely the aim of our project. We will use a public dataset to train and evaluate several machine learning models to predict diabetes. More precisely, we will use the data set "Pima Indians Diabetes Database"-which is available on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database" > Kaggle </a> to find factors that could be correlated with diabetes and build our machine learning models.
